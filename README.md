Please note that this folder also includes ECSS Approach, please look into [AppPerson.js](https://github.com/IamManchanda/react-app/blob/master/src/components/person/AppPerson.js#L6-L17) for an example on how to integrate them together.

## Special Note

Foundation specific classes like `grid-x`, `cell`, `callout`, `button` doesn't have to do anything with ECSS based Classes. In real project, you should be using Foundation's Sass Mixin to insert them as ECSS classes.
